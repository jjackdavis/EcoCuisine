## Ingredients

- 4 large baking potatoes
- 4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
- Salt and black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Scrub the baking potatoes clean under running water and pat them dry with a paper towel.

2. Prick the potatoes several times with a fork to allow steam to escape during baking. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper.

3. Bake the potatoes in the preheated oven for 45-60 minutes, or until they are tender when pierced with a fork.

4. Remove the baked potatoes from the oven and let them cool slightly.

5. Carefully slice each baked potato lengthwise down the center, without cutting all the way through.

6. Fluff the insides of the potatoes with a fork. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.

7. Top each baked potato with shredded cheddar cheese, crumbled bacon, and a dollop of sour cream.

8. Sprinkle chopped fresh chives over the loaded baked potatoes.

9. Serve immediately while hot.
