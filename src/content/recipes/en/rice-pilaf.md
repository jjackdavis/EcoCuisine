## Ingredients

- 1 cup long-grain white rice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil or butter
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain well and set aside.

2. Heat the olive oil or butter in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and saut√© until softened and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.

3. Add the rinsed and drained rice to the skillet with the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes until the rice is lightly toasted.

4. Pour the chicken or vegetable broth into the skillet with the rice mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

5. Bring the broth to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Simmer for 15-18 minutes, or until the rice is tender and has absorbed all of the liquid.

6. Remove the skillet from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes.

7. Fluff the rice pilaf with a fork and transfer it to a serving dish.

8. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if desired, and serve hot as a delicious side dish.
