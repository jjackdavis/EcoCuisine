## Ingredients

- 8 oz spaghetti or fettuccine pasta
- 4 slices bacon, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside.

2. While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced bacon and cook until crispy, about 5-6 minutes.

3. Add the minced garlic to the skillet with the bacon and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

4. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined.

5. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the cooked pasta to the bacon and garlic mixture. Toss to combine.

6. Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, stirring constantly to coat the pasta in the creamy sauce. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce.

7. If the sauce is too thick, gradually add the reserved pasta water a little at a time until you reach your desired consistency.

8. Season the pasta carbonara with salt and black pepper to taste.

9. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if desired, and serve immediately.

Enjoy this delicious Pasta Carbonara as a comforting and flavorful meal!
