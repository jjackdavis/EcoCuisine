## Ingredients

- 1 lb chicken breast, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ginger, minced
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1 bell pepper, sliced
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 carrot, sliced
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- Cooked rice or noodles, for serving

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, and sesame oil. Set aside.

2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant.

3. Add the sliced chicken breast to the skillet and stir-fry for 5-6 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink.

4. Add the sliced onion, bell pepper, broccoli florets, and carrot to the skillet. Stir-fry for an additional 4-5 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender-crisp.

5. Pour the sauce mixture over the chicken and vegetables in the skillet. Stir well to coat everything evenly in the sauce.

6. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the sauce has thickened slightly and everything is heated through.

7. Remove the skillet from the heat and serve the chicken stir-fry immediately over cooked rice or noodles.

Enjoy this delicious Chicken Stir Fry as a quick and satisfying meal!
